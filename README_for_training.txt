The data structure is as follows:

attention-module
	data
		Imagenet
			train
			val



Note: Imagenet/val should contain FOLDERS with images in these folder. Something looks like:
val
	n01440764  
	n01943899  
	n02105056  
	n02361337  
	n02843684  
	n03379051 
	...

if not, then you can use the 'valprep.sh' to put images into folders.
